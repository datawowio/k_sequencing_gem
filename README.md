## Getting Started

KSequencing 0.1.24 works with Rails 4.1 onwards. You can add it to your Gemfile with:
```ruby
gem 'k_sequencing', '~> 0.1.24'
```
Then run bundle install

Next, you need to run the generator:

```console
$ rails generate k_sequencing:install
```

The generator will install an initializer which describes ALL of KSequencing's configuration options. It is *imperative* that you take a look at it. When you are done, you are ready to add KSqeuencing to any of your codes.

You have to contact us [Datawow](https://datawow.io/pages/contact) to get your token. With this token you'll be able to use our gem properly.

      },
      ...
    ]
  },
  "status": 200,
  "message": "success",
  "total": 3,
  "meta": {
    "code": 200,
    "current_page": 1,
    "message": "success",
    "next_page": 2,
    "prev_page": -1,
    "total_count": 3,
    "total_pages": 2
  }
}
```

However `token: "[you_token]"` you can config in configuration file is not necessary to send to method every time you request, if you have one project token we recommeded this approach
